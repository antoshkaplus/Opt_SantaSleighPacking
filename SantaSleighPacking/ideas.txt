Tabu Search:
    Intensification:
    restart from best currently known solution
    and to 'freeze'(fix) in it the components
    that seem more attractive
    
    (after finding best solution save that state somewhere,
     then from that state try to find another good solution.
     when you fail after some number of iteration, go back go that 
     state and try again (but u should change something beforehand
     to make return effective))
     
    Diversification:
    avoid search in restricted porsion of solution space.
    - introduce a few arely used components in the current solution
    - integrate diversification considerations directly into 
        regular searching process
    - strategic oscilation (allowing infeasible solution) (can't use this really)
     
    (tabu most frequent unimproving moves)
    
    Always move to the best available neighbourhood solution point
    even if it is worse then the current solution point.
    
    
    
    
    
    
Every present has priority. At first priority defines by area of present, 
the we increase priority of unplaced rectangles. Priority gives tools to make
element go before another element with lower priority. But area still counts.
